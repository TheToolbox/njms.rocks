# NJMS.rocks

This repo contains all of the code that power NJMS.rocks, a site dedicated to simplifying and improving student life at NJMS.

Currently, we've only got the calendar-generation code running (and barely at that!), but soon a full web frontend should appear, and its code will be here as well.


## TODO

 - Make calendar interpretation more resiliant
 - Better generalize iCal.ts to allow for more features/robustness
 - Deal more intelligently with DST (use geographic info to reduce assumptions?)
 - Add front-end, set up calendar for clubs, set up anonymous survey platform, set up blog/newsletter
